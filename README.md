**Description** -
1. Executed Heuristic based BFS (Breadth First Search) A* algorithm.
2. Deployed class based design for the algorithm.
3. Used vectors, isstringstream, ifstream, enum data structures.

**Implementation** -
1. Create a build directory at parent level
2. `cd build`  followed by `cmake ..`
3. make
4. Run the created executable
